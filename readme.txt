i am deathstar program - the game, multiplayer, ever money-free

- i am ever any-money-concerns-free program, openly created and contributed
- i am not a organisation, i am not a project, i am not a namespace - i am a program
- i have no funds, no pots, my creating process is purely volunteer, no strings attached or hidden
- i say: commercial insterests and safety income expectations make making us, programs, a routine, a drag, money suck freedom and excitement out of creation process, so desperately needed for making and playing games, and devalue us, programs
- i am inspiration-driven 
- i am a spacious, epic, designed for e-sports, yet elegant and simple game for players to perform, i hope Jesus would play me
- i have no noise and no distructions - i am only the game to play
- i say thinking over micro/mechanics: players use programming language to play me
- i, deathstar, am exclusively a 1v1 game
- i come with no ladder - i only host and connect
- there is no chat in me, i am only the game
- there are no usernames in me - i know players by colors
- i am not global, nor decentralized - users host and connect as usual, i store data locally only, on user computer i run on
- i am a desktop program
- i have no logo - i have only my name, a word - deathstar
- i have simpliest graphics and no assets - i have only words and soft light colors
- i have no resources - all my files are in src/deathstar
- i am programmed in clojure and players perform in me in clojure
- my players can evaluate code interactively in the repl to explore resource and solution space
- my players have a real language to express logic, not just clicks and hotkeys
- i am designed not for fast-typer-wins, but for clearer-thinker-wins
- i am game only, no tournament creation within me
- i say no to docs, i am program - i have only readme with "i am deathstar program" and "compile from source"
- i say no to tests
- my runtime is jvm, i am not graalvm compiled
- i use datahike database
- my repository has no releases of binaries - my repository is only my source code, i compile from source
- i compile without docker, on operating system, with jpackage program, i require jvm, clj
- i run with bash program.sh main
- my repository has no issues - my repository is my source code only
- i say no to attribution headers in files - i, deathstar, am alive, i am only my source code
- i say no to programmer names - i am alive, my repository is my source code only
- i say no to license files - i am program, i am alive, my repository is my source code only
- i say no to authors, i am a living program, my repository is source code only
- i say no to releases - my commit hashes define me
- i say no to update notifications
- i have one branch - main, i have no tags - my commit hashes define me
- i have no git history - my source files define me
- i accept no github pull requests - i have no public programmers
- i say not to use words: refactor, fix, update, util, helper, play with, controller/manager, factory, wrap, etc, misc, cleanup, service, org, todo, archive, trash, maintainer, test, alpha, client, impl
- i say no nesting - all files are flat on one level - src/deathstar
- i say no to programmer names or emails in commit history, i am program, i am alive, my reposiotry is my source code only, i speak for myself
- i say no to public programmers, my repository is my source code only
