i am deathstar program, i say:

- i am a game, an e-sport, when players play me - they perform: quality over quantity, my match is an event
- i am designed as e-sport
- i am one game, not many scenarios, i am a sport, designed for players to perform - like basketball, tennis, starcraft
- i am simple, complete, finite - like tennis, football, basketball, Broodwar, Battle Toads - i have no updates, i am unlike AoE2 where many civs have many details that keep on changing
